    <h1>Jotform API - Issue Demo</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Using the <a target="_blank" href="https://api.jotform.com/docs/#libraries:~:text=Authenticate%20with%20Javascript%20SDK">Jotform JavaScript SDK</a>
        against Jotform.com works fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, using it against <a href="https://forms.bgsu.edu">forms.bgsu.edu</a> fails with CORS errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Called outside a browser context (no CORS), the API works fine for forms.bgsu.edu.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
        We have two nearly identical pages designed to test the Jotform
        <a target="_blank" href="https://api.jotform.com/docs/#libraries:~:text=Authenticate%20with%20Javascript%20SDK">JavaScript SDK</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="./jotform.html" >JotForms.com Example</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="./bgsuforms.html" >Forms.bgsu.edu Example</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Both examples prompt the user to authenticate and authorize the app.
        This appears to work successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, they try to fetch user information over the API. While the jotform.com
        variant works, the forms.bgsu.edu variant fails with CORs errors.
        This indicates that even though the application has been approved,
        the origin is not being allowed.
    </p>

    <h2>What is CORS</h2>
    <p>
        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows web browsers
        to access resources from other domains. CORS is used to prevent malicious websites
        from accessing data on other sites without permission.
